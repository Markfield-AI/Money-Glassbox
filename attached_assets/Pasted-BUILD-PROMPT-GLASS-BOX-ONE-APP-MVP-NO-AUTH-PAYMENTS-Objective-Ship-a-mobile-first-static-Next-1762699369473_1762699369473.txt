BUILD PROMPT — GLASS BOX (ONE-APP MVP, NO AUTH/PAYMENTS)
Objective

Ship a mobile-first, static Next.js PWA that demonstrates the core story:

Pick SDGs → 2) Browse a WETF → 3) See “Glass Box” Vetting → 4) Fake Invest → 5) View Return on Impact.

No servers, no logins, no Stripe. All state is client-side with localStorage.

Tech (simple + fast)

Next.js 14 (App Router) + TypeScript

TailwindCSS, shadcn/ui (or Radix primitives)

recharts for charts (radar + donut)

localStorage for persistence (no DB)

Lottie (optional) for success animation

Deploy: Vercel (static export-ready)

App Structure
/app
  /page.tsx                 -> Welcome
  /sdg/page.tsx             -> SDG selection + radar preview
  /discover/page.tsx        -> WETF list (one seed fund)
  /fund/[slug]/page.tsx     -> WETF detail + “Our Vetting” modal
  /success/page.tsx         -> Success screen
  /dashboard/page.tsx       -> Impact dashboard
  /manifest.webmanifest     -> PWA manifest
  /icons/*                  -> PWA icons
/components                 -> UI: Card, Modal, RadarChart, DonutChart, EquivalencyCard
/lib
  /copy.ts                  -> all strings
  /impact.ts                -> equivalency formulas
  /state.ts                 -> tiny store (zustand or React context) + localStorage sync
  /seed.ts                  -> mock data for WETFs
/styles/globals.css

Seed Data (/lib/seed.ts)
export const WETFS = [
  {
    slug: "health-wellbeing",
    title: "Health & Wellbeing Fund",
    description: "Scale vaccinations, primary care, and mental health access.",
    icon: "🩺",
    raisedDisplay: "£2.4m raised",
    livesImpactedDisplay: "150,000+ lives impacted",
    growthDisplay: "↑ 23% since June",
    sdgs: ["Health & Wellbeing", "Clean Water & Sanitation"],
    vetting: {
      financialHealth: true,
      governance: true,
      impactTracking: true
    }
  }
];

Impact Equivalencies (/lib/impact.ts)
export const IMPACT_RATES = {
  mealGBP: 0.25,       // £0.25 = 1 meal
  classroomGBP: 12500, // £12,500 = 1 classroom
  wellGBP: 2500        // £2,500 = 1 well
};

export function calculateEquivalencies(totalGBP: number) {
  return {
    meals: Math.floor(totalGBP / IMPACT_RATES.mealGBP),
    classrooms: +(totalGBP / IMPACT_RATES.classroomGBP).toFixed(2),
    wells: +(totalGBP / IMPACT_RATES.wellGBP).toFixed(2)
  };
}

Minimal Client Store (/lib/state.ts)

Keep in-memory state with hydration to localStorage:

selectedSDGs: string[]

impactProfile: number[] (8-dim radar values 0–100)

totalInvestedGBP: number (fake investment tally)

Provide actions:

setSDGs(sdgs), buildImpactProfile(sdgs)

fakeInvest(amountGBP) → increments totalInvestedGBP

Auto-save to localStorage on change; load on app start.

Copy (use as-is, /lib/copy.ts)
export const copy = {
  tagline: "See your impact, clearly.",
  valueProp: "Every pound you invest changes lives — and you can track every result.",
  sdgTitle: "Let’s find your impact focus.",
  sdgSub: "Choose the causes that matter to you most.",
  discoverTitle: "Invest in trusted, verified impact funds.",
  vettingTitle: "How we verify impact",
  vettingBullets: [
    "Financial Health: 75%+ program spend",
    "Accountability: independent board & public financials",
    "Impact Tracking: outcomes measured and reported"
  ],
  investPrompt: "How much would you like to invest?",
  investCTA: "Invest now (demo)",
  successH1: "Your seed has taken root.",
  successP: "Your investment is already at work — transforming lives.",
  dashboardH1: "See your Return on Impact.",
  dashboardKPI: "Total invested",
  eqMeals: "Meals provided",
  eqClassrooms: "Classrooms built",
  eqWells: "Wells funded"
};

Screens (exact behavior)

Welcome (/)

H1: “See your impact, clearly.”

Sub: “Every pound you invest…”

CTA: “Get started” → /sdg

SDG Selection (/sdg)

Grid of 8 SDG cards (Health, Education, Clean Water & Sanitation, Poverty & Hunger, Responsible Consumption, Infrastructure, Energy, Waste)

On select, show count “You’ve selected X areas”.

Button “Build my Impact Profile” → animate a radar chart from selections (client-only), then “Continue” → /discover.

Discover (/discover)

Section title: “Invest in trusted, verified impact funds.”

Show 1 WETF card (from seed): title, raised, lives, growth → “View fund”.

WETF Detail (/fund/health-wellbeing)

Tabs: Mission | Impact | Our Vetting

“Our Vetting” modal shows the 3 checkmarks (use vettingBullets copy).

“How much would you like to invest?” presets (£25 / £50 / £100) + custom input.

Invest now (demo) → calls fakeInvest(amount), route to /success.

Success (/success)

H1: “Your seed has taken root.”

Sub: “Your investment is already at work…”

CTA: “View my impact” → /dashboard.

Optional: Lottie seed→tree animation.

Dashboard (/dashboard)

H1: “See your Return on Impact.”

KPI “Total invested: £X”

3 equivalency cards: meals, classrooms, wells (computed from total invested).

Donut chart of portfolio (single slice for MVP).

Mini line chart of “My investment over time” using timestamps stored in state whenever fakeInvest is called.

PWA Essentials

Add /app/manifest.webmanifest with app name, theme color, icons.

Link manifest in root layout; include icons in /app/icons.

Enable Next.js appDir and static export capability (next.config.js with output: 'export' if you want a fully static export; otherwise standard Vercel deploy is fine).

Styling & UX

Mobile-first; tap targets ≥ 44px; WCAG AA contrast.

Use Tailwind + shadcn/ui Cards, Buttons, Tabs, Dialog (modal).

Keep transitions snappy (200–250ms).

Commands
# scaffold
npx create-next-app@latest glassbox --typescript --tailwind --eslint --app
cd glassbox

# add deps
pnpm add recharts zustand class-variance-authority tailwind-merge
# optional wow
pnpm add lottie-react

# dev
pnpm dev

# build (static export optional)
pnpm build
pnpm next export   # if you want pure static files in /out

Acceptance Criteria (demo must pass)

User completes Welcome → SDG → Discover → Fund → Invest (demo) → Success → Dashboard.

Radar chart reflects chosen SDGs (visual only; numbers can be simple mappings).

Pressing Invest now (demo) increments Total invested and persists via localStorage.

Dashboard shows updated equivalencies using formulas above.

“Our Vetting” modal displays the 3 trust bullets exactly as written.

App is installable as a PWA (manifest + icons present).

Out of Scope (explicit)

Auth, user accounts, payments, webhooks, real KYC, server/database, charity/admin portals.
