🚀 Glass Box MVP – Product Brief
🎯 Mission

To make generosity transparent — turning donations into visible, measurable social investments.

“Don’t just donate. Invest in change — and see your impact, clearly.”

🧩 Core Concept

A mobile-first web app where users:

Find their cause (SDG self-assessment → personalized impact profile)

Invest in a WETF (Glass Box–vetted charity funds)

See their Return on Impact (live dashboard of real-world results)

👤 Target User

Social Investor (SI) — ethically-minded donor who wants transparency, proof, and measurable impact.
Pain: “I never know what my donation actually does.”
Promise: “Now you can — every pound tells its story.”

⚙️ Architecture Decision Record (ADR)
Decision

Build the MVP as a single Next.js PWA backed by a simple Node/NestJS API + Stripe integration.

Context

We need one cohesive demo app — fast. The investor experience is the product story.
Charity and admin tools can follow once traction is proven.

Choice

Frontend: Next.js (React, Tailwind), deploy on Vercel.

Backend: Node/NestJS with PostgreSQL (hosted, e.g., Supabase or Neon).

Payments & KYC: Stripe Checkout + Stripe Identity.

Data: Seed with mock WETF & impact stats for demo.

Auth: Simple JWT; optional Google sign-in.

Why

✅ Focuses on the emotional, innovative core (transparency + impact)
✅ Simplifies deployment and team workflow (one app, one CI/CD)
✅ Flexible enough to expand into a full platform later (charity/admin layers)

Trade-offs

No charity-side data entry yet (impact manually seeded).

Limited admin tools; compliance handled manually for demo.

Status

Approved for MVP Build — optimized for hackathon demo + investor showcase.
